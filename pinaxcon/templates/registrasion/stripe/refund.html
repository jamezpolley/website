  <h2>Stripe refunds for credit note #{{ credit_note.id}}</h2>

  <p>This credit note is valued at ${{ credit_note.value }}.</p>

  <h3>Available refunds</h3>

  <p>Currently credit notes can only be cashed out in full in a single
    transaction. If you need to cash out to multiple small payments, you will
    need to manually invoke the refunds from the Stripe Dashboard.</p>
